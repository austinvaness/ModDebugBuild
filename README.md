# ModDebugBuild
 
This Space Engineers plugin allows mod developers to attach Visual Studio and other IDEs to the game and use breakpoints. As a side effect, this will disable Keen's additions like mod profiling. This plugin will only work on local mods. 

## Installation
In order to use this plugin, you must install [Plugin Loader](https://github.com/austinvaness/PluginLoader). After installing Plugin Loader, simply find and enable Mod Debugging in the plugin list from the game menu.
